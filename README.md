# Suspended Ticket Nuke App
A full-page nav bar app for bulk deleting suspended tickets by specified causes of suspension. Enabled causes are configured in the app's settings. The app settings are used to determine which causes of suspension to include when fetching the suspended tickets intended for bulk deletion.

Pull requests are welcome.

### Features on the Roadmap
* Ability to toggle the causes of suspension used within the app so configuration does not require updating the app settings
